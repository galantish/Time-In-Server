This is the server side.

For running this app you shoudld download:

node (include npm) - https://nodejs.org/en/ <br/>
after node installed <br/>
open cmd, and run: npm i nodemon <br/>
cd <project_dir> <br/>
run: npm install (should take few minutes) <br/>
run: nodemon ./src/server.js <br/>

now open a browser with http://localhost:8080 and you should get "Please send POST request". <br/>
it says the server works fine.
