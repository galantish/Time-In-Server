This is the server side.

For running this app you shoudld download:

node (include npm) - https://nodejs.org/en/
after node installed
open cmd, and run: npm i nodemon
cd <project_dir>
run: npm install (should take few minutes)
run: nodemon ./src/server.js

now open a browser with http://localhost:8080 and you should get "Please send POST request".
it says the server works fine.
